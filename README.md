# Canny-Filter-OpenCV

This is just a mini project when I'm learning OpenCV.<br>

## How this program works
1. Capture video from your webcam device
2. Gray scaling the video frame by frame
3. Applying bilateral filter to reduce some noises while keep the sharp edges
4. Use Canny Algorithm to find edges
5. Thresholding image by inverted binary to get black and white sketch.
